## Background 
Members of the CCIT-RCDE division and faculty from Clemson Genetics & Biochemistry Department, Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering Department, Electrical and Computer Engineering department and the School of Computing have joined forces to create modular poly-domain research generative AI ecosystem (Hub-Spoke model) on Palmetto2 called Clemson Advanced Computational Analytics and Learning for Integrated Science Translation (CATALYST--possible system name).

Phase one of CATALYST development is applying the OpenAI system on Plametto2 (codex, MCP server, vLLM) to build a Life Science research facet called bioLLM (placeholder name).

bioLLM builds upon recent advances in biological foundation models, Stanford's Biomni framework, and openAI LLM middleware (codex, MCP server), the team has created an extensible, locally-deployed AI platform prototype operating on Clemson's Palmetto2 HPC cluster. The ecosystem addresses current limitations in fragmented bioinformatics tools, scalability, security, and sustainability. Through an innovative agentic framework, Clemson researchers will gain access to specialized bioLLMs for genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and systems biology applications.   

In order to facilitate usage and harden this system, we will be hosting hackathons in 2026 with exclusive access to alpha test bioLLM ecosystem.  The first hackathon will be a small group of hackers that will test prompt the agentic bioLLM system to perform scientific discovery, usage documentation, and identify gaps in the system.  

## When & Where
The second Workshop will be a drop in on March 6(Fri) from 9am to noon followed by Discord collaboration for 7 days.
There will be synchronous Zoom meeting at 9am-10am https://clemson.zoom.us/j/9452064261   
Feltus will be in Zoom 9am to noon each day.   

## Collaboration. 
Discord server invite: https://discord.gg/4QU39zjs
Discord server URL: https://discord.com/channels/1461097829706760202/1461097830239305923

## Pre-workshop tasks (User)
1.	Obtain OpenAI account with your clemson.edu email (not g.clemson.edu)
2.  Install codex with https://git.rcd.clemson.edu/biollms/biocodex
3.  Run some test prompts.

## Pre-workshop tasks (Admin)
1. Tool inventory, format and installation documentation
2. Log parsing documentation.
3. Genomic data access documentation
4. General biological workflow documentation for a Python/bash iterate user:  
    * ExperimentalDesign>>>InputDataCollection>>>Algorithm(Code)>>>Results
    * Working Directory structure (input_data, code, results, methods, logs) 

## Workshop Charge 
You have two choices:
1. Reproduce a recent task/project from your research using bioLLM.
2. Develop a new tool for bioLLM to access.

In concert, you will test the OpenAI LLM and bioLLM agent ability to generate useful biological results from existing tools. Gaps will be documented and submitted as
